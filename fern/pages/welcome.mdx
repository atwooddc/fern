## Motivation

<div className="motivation">
APIs underpin the internet but are still painful to work with. They are often untyped, 
unstandardized, and out-of-sync across multiple sources of truth.

While companies like Stripe, Twilio, and AWS have the resources to develop internal 
tools for developer experience, most businesses can't. **That's why we are building Fern.**

Fern allows engineering teams to offer developer-friendly 
APIs that convert more developers. Input OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) 
and output idiomatic SDKs and beautiful documentation.
