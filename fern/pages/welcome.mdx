## Motivation

<div className="motivation">
APIs underpin the internet but are still painful to work with. They are often untyped, 
unstandardized, and out-of-sync across multiple sources of truth.

While companies like Stripe, Twilio, and AWS have the resources to develop internal 
tools for developer experience, most businesses can't.

That's why we are building Fern. Fern allows engineering teams to offer developer-friendly 
APIs, including easy-to-use SDKs and up-to-date developer documentation. Just input an 
OpenAPI(formerly Swagger) or AsyncAPI Spec, and output idiomatic SDKs and beautiful documentation.
