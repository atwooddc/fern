title: What is an SDK?
description: Generate robust, flexible, and automated SDKs in multiple programming languages.
---

SDKs (Software Development Kits) reduce the amount of work required to use a REST API, starting by reducing the boilerplate code a developer would otherwise have to write. By simplifyoing the process of making API calls, developers have a faster time-to-integration and run into fewer errors. SDKs are platform-specific and comprised of:

1. **Client Libraries**: Pre-written code that provides functionality for interacting with an API, saving developers from having to write this code from scratch. 
1. **Code Examples**: Example snippets that show example API requests, responses, and schemas (i.e., data models).
1. **Utilities**: Helper functions that help with tasks such as retrying requests, paginating responses, refreshing OAuth tokens, and verifying webhook requests.

## Fern SDKs

Fern generates robust, flexible, and automated SDKs, enabling developers to use 
your API effectively in popular languages. Fern SDKs offer autocomplete in 
code editors. (For less technical folks, think of that nice drop-down when you hit "=" in Excel/GSheets.) Developers also get type checking, schema validation at compile time, support for server-sent events streaming, and more. 

- **Extensible and customizable.** Enhance your Fern-generated SDK with
handwritten functions and customize your SDK method and group names.

- **Automatically generated.** When your API definition changes, a CI/CD 
job kicks off to build, version, and release your updates SDKs.

- **Idiomatic code.**: Fern SDKs read as if a language expert wrote them. 
Each SDK generator is built from scratch, maintained by the Fern team, 
and designed to follow the best practices of each language (i.e., a Python SDK is Pythonic).
