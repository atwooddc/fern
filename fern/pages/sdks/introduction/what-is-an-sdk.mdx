title: What is an SDK?
description: Generate robust, flexible, and automated SDKs in multiple programming languages.
---

<Info>
SDKs (Software Development Kits) are platform-specific tools that 
enable faster software development. This could include pre-built modules, compilers, and
user guides. 
</Info>

Fern provides robust, flexible, and automated SDKs, enabling developers to use 
your API effectively in many languages. Fern SDKs offer [autocomplete](/learn/sdks/features/strongly-typed) in 
code editors, [type checking](/learn/sdks/features/strongly-typed), [schema validation](/learn/sdks/features/schema-validation) at compile time, support for [webhooks](/learn/sdks/features/webhook-signature-verification), and more. 

- **Fern SDKs are extensible and customizable.** Supplement your Fern-generated SDK with
handwritten functions and customize your SDK method and group names.

- **Automate your SDKs without sacrificing quality.** Your SDKs update alongside your API Spec. 
Show developers how to use your SDKs with code examples that automatically populate in your 
documentation.

Fern supports generating SDKs in several different programming languages, including 
Typescript, Python, and Go. Each SDK generator is written by a language expert and 
is officially maintained by the Fern team.
