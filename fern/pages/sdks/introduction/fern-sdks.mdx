title: SDKs built with Fern
description: Generate robust, flexible, and automated SDKs in multiple programming languages.
---

Fern generates robust, flexible, and automated SDKs, enabling developers to use
your API effectively in popular languages.

- **Extensible and customizable.** Enhance your Fern-generated SDK with
handwritten functions and customize your SDK method and group names.
- **Automatically generated.** When your API definition changes, a CI/CD
job kicks off to build, version, and release your updated SDKs.
- **Idiomatic code.**: SDKs built with Fern read as if a language expert wrote them.
Each SDK generator is built from scratch, maintained by the Fern team,
and designed to follow the best practices of each language (i.e., a Python SDK is Pythonic).

SDKs built with Fern offer autocomplete in code editors, type checking, 
schema validation at compile time, support for server-sent events streaming, and more.

## Features

### Code Examples

Example API requests, responses, and schemas (i.e., data models) from your API Spec automatically populate in the codebase of the client library. 
SDK snippets showcasing the examples also automatically populate in your Fern Docs API Reference.
